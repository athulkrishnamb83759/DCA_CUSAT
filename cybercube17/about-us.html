        <p>The establishment of the erstwhile University of Cochin in 1971 was a commitment from the Government of Kerala towards the new scientific policy resolution adopted by the Central Government on 4th March 1958.  The birth of the new University was with the specific purpose of “development of higher education with particular emphasis on post-graduate studies and research in applied science, technology, industry and commerce”.  The University of Cochin was later reorganized as Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT) in February 1986. </p>
        The University’s basic philosophy and goals find eloquent expression in its Coat of Arms emblazoning the motto ‘Tejaswinavadhitamastu’ which in essence means ‘may the wisdom accrued deify us both-the teacher and the taught-and percolate to the universe in its totality’.  The University has strengthened its contacts and collaborative tie-ups with international universities and institutions and is in the path of growth as a global centre for generation of new knowledge in frontier areas of learning.  CUSAT has entered into academic collaborations and exchange programmes with many notable institutions across the USA, Europe, Russia, Japan, France, Korea etc.</div>
      <div class="clear"></div>
      The UGC has selected CUSAT as a University with the potential for Excellence.  The Government of Kerala has selected CUSAT for establishing an Inter University Center for Nano Materials and devices, Inter University Center for IPR studies and Inter University Center for Marine Biotechnology.  CUSAT has successfully implemented the ERUDITE – the scholars – in-residence programme of the Government of Kerala.  The University has also extended its facilities and expertise to impart in-house training and orientation to students and teachers of high school classes in the Government and Government aided sector.</div>

        <p>The Department of Computer Applications of Cochin University of Science and Technology was established in 1992 to facilitate research and human resource development in the area of Computer Science and Information Technology.  The research activities of the department include a wide variety of areas such as Machine Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence, Fuzzy Logic, Neural Network, Data Mining, Image Processing, Indian Language Computing, Cryptography and Coding Theory, Network Security, Quantum Computing, Simulation, Pattern Recognition, Assistive Software Technologies, Cyber Intelligence, Graph Algorithms and Computational Chemistry.   </p>
        The Master of Computer Applications (MCA) programme was started (1994) with a model curriculum prepared jointly by ISTE and the Department of Electronics, Government of India with minor modifications.  The Syllabus is updated periodically based on the current trends and requirements of the industry.  The Department has proud alumni, most of them being placed in much reputed international firms like IBM, WIPRO, INFOSYS, TCS, CTS etc. </div>
      <div class="clear"></div>
      The department has started M.Sc. in Computer Science (M.Sc.CS) with specialization in Soft Computing. This programme aims to develop core competence in Computer Science and prepare the students to carry out development work, as well as take up challenges in research. The Department of Computer Applications is also doing consultancy work for public and private sector undertakings.  The Department has an excellent library with more than 5000 books and various National and International journals.  The Department has a well-equipped laboratory, which is being constantly updated with the latest computers.</div>

      <div class="clear"></div>
      Cyber Intelligence research has not grown at par with cybercrime scenario. We have a dearth of trained personnel in this area. Considering the current scenario, the Department of Computer Applications of Cochin University of Science and Technology has ventured upon Cyber Intelligence Research laboratory with the financial aid of Govt. of Kerala. The laboratory is equipped with state of the art facility to support Cyber Intelligence research.</div>
